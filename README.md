# Quora-Question-Similarity-detection
This project uses machine learning algorithms to detect duplicate Quora question pairs. Leveraging NLP preprocessing techniques, I formatted the dataset for optimal algorithm performance. Using the Quora Question Pairs dataset on Kaggle, I achieved 80% accuracy in identifying duplicate question pairs.
